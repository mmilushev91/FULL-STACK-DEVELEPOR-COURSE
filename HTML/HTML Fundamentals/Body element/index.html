<!-- 1.Add a body to your web page using the <body> element.
2. Add the following code between your opening and closing body tags:

<p>
  "Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." - Audre
  Lorde
</p>

Note: While some browsers may render some content outside body tags accommodate
the occasional mistake in your HTML, not all browsers do this! The best way to
ensure that all your HTML renders the same way in all browsers is to ensure that
your elements remain within the opening and closing body tags. -->

<body>
  <p>
    "Life is very short and what we have to do must be done in the now." - Audre
