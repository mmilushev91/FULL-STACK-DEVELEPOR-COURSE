1. Alejandra has begun to build out her business’s website. 
She wants to link from her homepage to a different page that contains 
her resume.

To start, look in index.html for the text that says 25
 years of experience — it should be near line 20. Put an anchor
tag (<a>) around this text.

2. Add a href attribute to this anchor tag, and give it the value /resume.html.
This URL is called a relative path and it looks a 
little different from the full URLs you’re used to seeing. 
That’s because it’s actually a link to another page on the same website, 
so we can omit the first part. Instead of www.jetsetter.com/resume.html 
we can abbreviate the link to just /resume.html.

3.Click on the link that you just made to navigate to see Alejandra’s resume!
