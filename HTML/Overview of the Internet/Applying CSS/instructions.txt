1.On line 6 of index.html, copy and paste the code below to apply 
the CSS file to the existing HTML.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

2.Just a little CSS can make the difference between a website that looks 
like a skeleton and portfolio-ready site.
Now let’s tweak the CSS just a little bit, to see how the visual rules
specified in CSS can change the way that a website is displayed.
Navigate to the style.css and scroll down to line 37 where you will 
see the h1 selector. This section defines the styles for the h1 element 
on the page, which is the most prominent heading.
Just for practice, change the color property from white to black.

3.If you look at the rendered browser, you’ll notice 
that the heading text is no longer readable in-front of the image.
Let’s change the color property within the h1 selector back to white.
