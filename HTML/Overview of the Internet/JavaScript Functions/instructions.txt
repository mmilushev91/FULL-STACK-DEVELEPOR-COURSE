1.First, let’s take a look at the JavaScript in the index.html file.
The JavaScript code is between the <script> tags. 
This tag alerts the browser that the page contains 
JavaScript and separates the JavaScript code from the HTML.
Find the JavaScript function changeColor(). 
This function chooses a color from a list of colors.

How does that happen?

First, the getRandomColor() function generates a random series of
numbers and letters to create a new hexadecimal color code.
It then saves the new color under the name newColor.

let newColor = getRandomColor();

On the next line, the document keyword accesses the page’s 
background color and sets it equal to the new color.

document.body.style.backgroundColor = newColor;

Click the Run button to move on to the next checkpoint to see 
how we can let a user change the color!

2. The next step is to connect the changeColor() JavaScript function with an 
event, so that when we click the Repaint! button, it changes the 
background color.

An event is something that can happen in a browser, like clicking or 
hovering with your mouse.
HTML attributes can set events, where the name of the attribute is 
the event and the value of the attribute is the JavaScript function that we want to execute.
In this case, the name of the event is onclick and we can 
invoke the function by calling "changeColor()".
Paste this code into the opening tag of the button element: 
onclick="changeColor()".

3. Let’s test out the functionality of the code that we 
just added. When you click the “Repaint!” button, the background color of the
site should be reset at random!
